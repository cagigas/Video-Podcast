## Video Podcast Webb App
The goal of this work sample is to create a web app which lets you browse and watch a subset of the CNN Video Podcast catalog (http://www.cnn.com/services/podcasting/)

Web App is working in Chrome and Firefox. In order to avoid the CORS, I use the package 'cors-anywhere', it's a NodeJS proxy which adds CORS headers to the proxied request and they
have live proxies running, so you don't have to install anything to see my app working.
